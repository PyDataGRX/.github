## PyData GRX (English version)

PyData GRX is a node of [Pydata](https://pydata.org) an international community where to share good practices, new approaches and technologies for data management, processing, analysis and visualization. The PyData communities address data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia and R.

In our node we have a bi-monthly meeting in the usual format of the PyData groups. We will have the presentations of two speakers, followed by a more informal session where we can get to know each other better and exchange ideas and opinions.

In this Github you will find all the materials and resources that are generated in the group, such as presentations, notebooks, codes, etc.
